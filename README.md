## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned


```html
<div class="first_item"> Equilibrium #3429</div>
```
```css
 .first_item {
      color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
       }
```
### Continued development

This project exposed many weaknesses in my coding and i will have to dive deeper into the word of responsive web design in order to become better. I will also be going into javascript proper.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me overlay the icon-view picture on the image-equilibrium picture.. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Stack Overflow](https://www.StackOverflow.com) - This was my go to site when i had any type of issues. i realized that others before me had gone through those problems and solutions were available. I'd recommend it to anyone still to code.
